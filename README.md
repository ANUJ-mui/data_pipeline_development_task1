##YOU HAVE TO ENTER DESCRIPTION OF YOUR TASK
This code is a complete data processing pipeline using Python's Pandas and NumPy libraries to simulate and analyze dummy transaction data. It begins by generating synthetic data with fields like transaction ID, customer ID, transaction date, amount, product category, and location. The data is then cleaned by removing nulls and non-positive transaction amounts. After cleaning, the data is transformed by extracting the transaction year from the date. Finally, the code aggregates the total transaction amount by product category. Each stage—generation, cleaning, transformation, and aggregation—is encapsulated in separate functions to maintain modularity and clarity, with sample outputs printed at each step for verification.
